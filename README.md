# Vite React UI with Tailwind CSS

## Overview
This project is a frontend UI built with React, Vite, and TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS. It is designed as a chatbot setup UI with form steps that require random values to proceed. The project is deployed on Vercel for easy access and testing.

## Technologies Used
- **Vite** - Fast build tool for modern frontend development.
- **React** - UI library for building interactive components.
- **TypeScript** - Adds type safety and improved development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform for frontend applications.

3. Start the development server:

4. Open the app in your browser:
